To all open hardware enthusiasts out there, welcome to this repo. 

What is The Box?
-------------------
The Box is literally what it's name says: The Box. 
The main difference between this box and all other boxes is that this box is remotely lockable. 
Why to worry about all those keys, and who has the key, when you can simply lock it,
or unlock it over the internet? Simply connect your The Box to your WiFi network, install an app on 
your phone, or register on a web site, link your The Box, and you're ready to go. Simply put your stuff inside,
and press "lock".
